## Getting started

1. Add a template

    After you have created your [transactional template](https://app.mailjet.com/templates/transactional),
    add the confirmation link variable (`{{var:confirmationlink:""}}`) to it.

1. Add shortcode

    Add `[mailjet_integration]` anywhere to see the subscription form.

## Configuration

### Shortcodes

So far the following shortcodes are available.

-   `[mailjet_integration]`

    The subscription form

-   `[mailjet_integration_response]`

    The response after clicking the confirmation link. Put this in your Success/Failure pages.

### Template variables

So far the following variables are available and can be used in your transactional Mailjet templates.

-   confirmationlink

    The link to confirm a subscribers e-mail address.

-   approximatename
